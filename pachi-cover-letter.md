Hi there {responsable name or area},

My name is Patricia but everyone knows me by Pachi, and I am a cat mom and community lover.
In my last position, I worked as a Developer Advocate at GitHub with a focus on the Brazilian community, where I daily engaged, nurtured, and grew communities around Open Source. 
I am also co-founder of Feministech, an online tech community to inspire and support women and LGBTQIA+ to transition and grow in tech, and it has been really great to see all the impact this community has on our members, not only profissional but their personal lives as well. Feministech is how I found out I loved DevRel and helping people grow,
I love advocating for developers and it would be great to work on a place where I have the chance to connect with developers, gather they feedback and share internally to a team that really cares and is ready to take their feedback to make the product better.

My passion for community and supporting developers as well as my experience working with fully remote and distributed teams and specially my willingness to learn new things makes me a great fit for this position.

Looking forward to hear from you,

Pachi Parra
